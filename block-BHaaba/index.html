            <p>Post its release, Delhi Crime received rave reviews,
                 primarily<br> for its writing, direction and performances.</p>
            <!-- <p> The Indian Express’ critic Shubhra Gupta gave 3.5 stars to the crime-drama and wrote in her review, 
                “Delhi Crime is a fictionalized crime drama, based on the 
                painstaking investigation which led to the capture of the six men who attacked the couple. </p>
            <p>It works best when it sticks to the assembling of a team that the deputy commissioner
                 of police Vartika Chaturvedi (Shah) can trust, led by the unflappable Tailang, and his
                  band of men, crack trackers, investigators, informers, who fan out and nab the culprits, 
                  one by one. The seven-part series, expertly shot, takes us back to the crime that we all wish had never 
                taken place. And shows that crime does lead, as it should, to punishment.”</p>          -->

            <p>Richie Mehta’s reaction was cautious and circumspet.<br> He thought it was too controversial 
                to handle.<br> I persuaded him to read
                 the chargesheet and the court’s<br> order in the case before rejecting my suggestion.</p>
            <!-- <p>The shooting commenced in Delhi, mostly on the roads. No sets were used. I advised the 
                producers not to involve my successors who would neither approve of the project nor would 
                they give any support, since the case was their predecessor’s — a common failing observed in the police.
                 Thus, the entire shoot was done almost in a hush-hush manner without formal permissions.</p>      -->
